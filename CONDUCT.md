We welcome individuals regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Responsibilities
- Decisions: Decisions will be made by a group majority vote. They will cover topics about planning, member behavior, and any emergencies that may arrive.

  expected to work around a members absencse. Emergencies may include sickness, family problems, etc.
- Assignments: Assignments will be decided via interest in it and respective user story. Equally distribute work and help other members if need be. Members who submit poor work
  without talking to other members beforehand are expected to work on assignment again if majority group decides.
- Participation: Members are expected to participate in a consistent matter, however, should work on topics they show more interest towards. Member opinion will be validated in order

  day works best.
- Agenda/Notes: Scrum master will take down notes of any discreprancies and/or importance they feel should be written.
- Lateness: Lateness will be tolerated as long as user makes it within a timely matter. A grace period of 15 minutes will be prompted with no questions asked. Member will be prompted to 
 advise others if they will be late pass this grace period. Failure to do so will be talked about as a group later on.
