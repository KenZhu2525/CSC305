Our business plan is wrtten based on the [Lean Canvas](https://www.leancanvas.com/) template.
A Lean Canvas is a one-page business plan template that helps entrepreneurs break down their ideas into key assumptions. It provides a more visual and streamlined approach to business planning than traditional business plans, it also saves papers. The Lean Canvas focuses on identifying the problems, solutions, key metrics, and competitive advantages, making it especially useful for startups looking to iterate quickly.

Our product Campus Canvas is a community-driven mobile app with a unique twist: users must physically visit specific real-life locations to place virtual pixels based on their real-world location. This app draws inspiration from Reddit, particularly r/Place, where a vast canvas allows users to add a single pixel every few minutes. With Campus Canvas, users can only place pixels once every 5 minutes, encouraging collaboration as they work together to create artwork while exploring the campus in an engaging way.
