## Takeaways & Observations

### Observation 1: Current description of the application is too difficult to understand.

Most of the people on the survey, including those that were familiar/participated in r/place, failed to see the purpose/objective/collaboration of the application\
> _"Currently Iâ€™m not getting the idea of the appeal of this app? Is it just to make community art? Is it to facilitate communication between college students? What does it offer differently from Instagram and Campus forum discussion apps such as Yikyak?"_\

**Team Action: Rewrite app description to narrow concept**\

### Observation 2: Colors.

3/4 of users responded with preference to sharp colors.\
>_Q5 Sharp color preferance_\
>**75%** Sharp color\
>**25%** Pastel color\

**Team Action: Pallette should be smaller in size and limited to high contrast.**\

### Observation 3: App interest is low.

Less than 50% of users responded to being interested in a beta. This could possibily be related to unclear descriptions of how our application will work.\
> 2 Users who heard of r/place and participated declined beta invite\
> 7 Users who did not know of r/place declined beta invite\
> Most of the users who were not familiar with r/place declined beta invite\
> Some users who seemed interested in the application concept, and provided unique ideas, also declined invite.\

**Team Action: Narrow app concept, improve features and build on ideas from the community**\

### Observation 4: Unique ideas from users.

A few users provided unique ideas, one of the biggest was to provide an active montior/feed of the full campus\
>_"I think the university should agree to have live monitors spread around the campus showing live feed of the updated drawing.\
>The monitors can be harnessed to make announcements and advertisements for school and club events.\
>There could be a drawing for each major so the university could have competitions.\
>As well as a drawing for each club and a general drawing for the whole university."_\

**Team Action: Create a webpage to pull the current version of the campus every couple of seconds/minutes to show collaborator's impact**\
