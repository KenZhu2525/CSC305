Campus Canvas is a community-driven mobile app with a unique twist: users must physically visit specific real-life locations to place virtual pixels based on their real-world location. This app draws inspiration from Reddit, particularly the subreddit r/Place, where a vast canvas allowed users to add a single pixel every few minutes. With Campus Canvas, users can only place pixels once every 5 minutes, encouraging collaboration as they work together to create artwork while exploring the campus in an engaging way.
