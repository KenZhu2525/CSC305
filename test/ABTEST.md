**A/B Test: Pixel Placement Frequency**

**User Story Number:** US-2

**Metric (from the HEART grid):** Engagement

**Hypothesis:** Users may engage more with the app if they are allowed to place pixels on the map more frequently. We hypothesize that increasing the frequency of pixel placements from once every 5 minutes to once every 2 minutes will lead to higher user engagement and more collaborative pixel placement.

**Experiment:**
- **Audiences:** Allocate 50% of the user base to the experiment group, and the other 50% to the control group.
- **Experiment Setup:** The experiment group can place pixels every 2 minutes, while the control group continues with the existing 5-minute interval.
- **Tracking:** Use Firebase Analytics to track user interactions related to pixel placements. Measure user engagement by tracking the number of pixels placed and the time spent on the app.
- **Success Metrics:** The primary success metric is the increase in the number of pixels placed within a specified time period in the experiment group compared to the control group.
- **Variations:** The primary variation is the frequency of pixel placements, with one group having a 2-minute interval and the other group retaining the 5-minute interval. Diagrams or mockups can illustrate how this change will be implemented in the app's user interface.

**A/B Test: User Engagement with Social Features**

**User Story Number:** US-6

**Metric (from the HEART grid):** Engagement

**Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that incorporating social features into the app, such as a chat room for users to discuss pixel placements, will lead to higher user engagement. Users who interact with others and collaborate are likely to spend more time in the app.

**Experiment:**
- **Audiences:** Assign 50% of users to the experiment group, and the other 50% to the control group.
- **Experiment Setup:** The experiment group will have access to a chat room within the app, while the control group will not have this feature.
- **Tracking:** Use Firebase Analytics to monitor user interactions within the chat room, including the number of messages sent, user participation, and chat room activity.
- **Success Metrics:** The primary success metric is increased user engagement, measured by the time spent in the app and the frequency of pixel placements. Compare the experiment group's engagement with the control group's engagement to assess the impact of social features.
- **Variations:** The primary variation is the addition of a chat room feature in the experiment group. Diagrams or mockups can illustrate the user interface changes for this feature.
