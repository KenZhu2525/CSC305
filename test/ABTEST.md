**A/B Test: Pixel Placement Frequency**

**User Story Number:** US-2

**Metric (from the HEART grid):** Engagement

**Hypothesis:** Users may engage more with the "Campus Canvas" app if they are allowed to place pixels on the map more frequently. We hypothesize that increasing the frequency of pixel placements from once every 5 minutes to once every 2 minutes will lead to higher user engagement and more collaborative pixel placement.

**Experiment:**
- **Audiences:** Allocate 50% of the user base to the experiment group, and the other 50% to the control group.
- **Experiment Setup:** The experiment group can place pixels every 2 minutes, while the control group continues with the existing 5-minute interval.
- **Tracking:** Use Firebase Analytics to track user interactions related to pixel placements. Measure user engagement by tracking the number of pixels placed and the time spent on the app.
- **Success Metrics:** The primary success metric is the increase in the number of pixels placed within a specified time period in the experiment group compared to the control group.
- **Variations:** The primary variation is the frequency of pixel placements, with one group having a 2-minute interval and the other group retaining the 5-minute interval. Diagrams or mockups can illustrate how this change will be implemented in the app's user interface.
