**Collecting Screen Time Metric:**

- **How to Collect Screen Time:** Firebase Analytics can track general app usage, including screen time. This allows us to monitor the total time users spend within the app.
- **Tools and Processes:** To collect this data, we will:
   - Configure Firebase Analytics to automatically collect screen time information.
   - Utilize screen view events to record the instances when users enter and exit different app screens.
   - Rely on Firebase Analytics to calculate the time spent on each screen, based on the data generated by these events.
 
**Collecting User Growth at Specific Intervals:**

- **How to Collect:** To measure user acquisition at designated time intervals, Firebase Analytics provides a robust tool for data collection.
- **Tools and Processes:**
   - **Define Intervals:** Start by defining the specific time intervals we want to monitor (e.g., weekly, monthly).
   - **Set Up Custom Events:** Create custom events within Firebase Analytics to capture user sign-ups or app installations. Ensure that these events include timestamps.
   - **Timestamp Tracking:** Use event parameters to record timestamps when users sign up or install the app.
   - **Data Analysis:** Export the data from Firebase Analytics and perform an in-depth analysis to identify trends in user growth during the specified intervals.
   - **Visualize Data:** Generate visual representations, such as graphs or charts, to effectively illustrate user acquisition patterns over different time frames.



**Collecting Download Rate Metric:**
- **How to Collect:** To measure the download rate of our app, we can utilize app store analytics and Firebase Analytics to track the number of app installations.
- **Tools and Processes:**
   - App Store Analytics: Leverage the analytics provided by app stores (e.g., Google Play Store, Apple App Store) to track the number of app downloads over time.
   - Firebase Analytics: Additionally, we can use Firebase Analytics to monitor app installation events. Set up custom events to record when users successfully download and install the app.
   - Comparative Analysis: Perform a comparative analysis between the data from the app store analytics and Firebase Analytics to ensure consistency and accuracy in tracking download rates.
 

**Collecting Active Hours Metric:**
How to Collect: To measure the active hours of users in our app, we can use Firebase Analytics and time tracking features to monitor user activity during specific time periods.
Tools and Processes:
Firebase Analytics: Utilize Firebase Analytics to track user activity within the app over different time intervals. Set up custom events to record when users are actively engaged with the app.
Time Tracking Features: Implement time tracking features within our app to record the hours during which users are most active. This can include monitoring user sessions and interactions during specific hours of the day.
Data Analysis: Analyze the data collected from Firebase Analytics and time tracking features to identify the hours when user activity is at its peak.

**Collecting Total Users Metric:**
How to Collect: To measure the total number of users, we can use user analytics and Firebase Analytics to track and record user accounts.
Tools and Processes:

User Analytics: Utilize user analytics platforms to continuously track and record user account creation. These platforms provide insights into the total number of registered users.
Firebase Analytics: Additionally, we can use Firebase Analytics to monitor user activity and sign-up events within the app. Set up custom events to track user registrations.
Data Validation: Ensure that the data from user analytics and Firebase Analytics align to validate the accuracy of the total user count.
