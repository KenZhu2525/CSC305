**Collecting Screen Time Metric:**

- **How to Collect Screen Time:** Firebase Analytics can track general app usage, including screen time. This allows us to monitor the total time users spend within the app.
- **Tools and Processes:** To collect this data, we will:
   - Configure Firebase Analytics to automatically collect screen time information.
   - Utilize screen view events to record the instances when users enter and exit different app screens.
   - Rely on Firebase Analytics to calculate the time spent on each screen, based on the data generated by these events.
 
**Collecting User Growth at Specific Intervals:**

- **How to Collect:** To measure user acquisition at designated time intervals, Firebase Analytics provides a robust tool for data collection.
- **Tools and Processes:**
   - **Define Intervals:** Start by defining the specific time intervals we want to monitor (e.g., weekly, monthly).
   - **Set Up Custom Events:** Create custom events within Firebase Analytics to capture user sign-ups or app installations. Ensure that these events include timestamps.
   - **Timestamp Tracking:** Use event parameters to record timestamps when users sign up or install the app.
   - **Data Analysis:** Export the data from Firebase Analytics and perform an in-depth analysis to identify trends in user growth during the specified intervals.
   - **Visualize Data:** Generate visual representations, such as graphs or charts, to effectively illustrate user acquisition patterns over different time frames.
